##start frontend

### insatll node and npm
e.g from here:
https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm
version shouldn't matter but just in case this is version I was using 

`npm --version`
`8.3.0`

`node --version`
`v17.3.0`

###Run the thing
After installing just type `npm start` and it should open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser


#Dealing with github
Don't push anything to master

Create your own branch and commit it there

Also don't merge your branch with master - that's the point of it

Create pull request
